# Unit Testing Demo

Some unit testing for a workshop where we learn about TDD and work with some of its concepts.

## Tests

I created tests for a method that would take a word and reverse it, and return true if it was a palindrome.
- One of the tests was to make sure that this indeed works correctly.
- And the second test was to see that the method returns the correct exception if the input is empty.

For the second set of tests I wrote some unit tests for a method that would sort a string in alphabetical order.
- The first test makes sure that the sorting process works correctly.
- The second test was to see that the method returns the correct exception if the input is empty.
- The third test made sure that the correct exception is thrown if any non-english letters were included in the string.
